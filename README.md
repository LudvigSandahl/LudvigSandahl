# Hi, I'm Ludvig 👋

I'm graduating in **Computer and Systems Sciences (Spring 2026)** in Stockholm. I enjoy building practical solutions close to end users, especially **integrations**, **data mapping**, and **lightweight automation**.

## Current focus
- Python (scripts, REST integrations)
- SQL (transformations, quality checks)
- TypeScript/JavaScript (simple UI + API interaction)

## What you'll find here
A few small projects around everyday dev tasks: moving data between systems, cleaning it up, and making sure it behaves. Usually I start with a dry-run, then turn it into something repeatable.
