# Hi, I'm Ludvig

I'm graduating in **Computer and Systems Sciences (Spring 2026)** in Stockholm. I enjoy problem solving at the intersection of users, systems and data. Building small tools, improving workflows and learning new tech along the way.


## Current focus
- **Python** (scripts, APIs, small terminal tools)
- **SQL** (cleanup, transformations, quality checks)
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (simple UI + API interaction)
- **Cloud & security** (hands-on labs and small projects as I learn)


## What you'll find here
A few small projects that are meant to be readable and runnable. I usually start with a “dry-run” approach (measure/validate first), then turn it into something repeatable.
